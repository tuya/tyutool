Ctypes Low-Level API
====================

All the functions, structures and datatypes are the same as in the C
implementation, except for some that couldn't be translated. If you
want to use them natively you will have to use ctypes' data
types. Please refer to the official documentation and the C headers.

You can import the various functions from pyogg.ogg, pyogg.vorbis,
pyogg.opus and pyogg.flac or use the predefined classes and functions
from pyogg.
